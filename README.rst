:Status: Proof of Concept

A simple PaaS inspired by dokku but built with vagga_, cantal_, lithos_ and
verwalter_. We also use nginx, rsync, linux and more, they are pretty
ubuquitous, though.

See `Verwalter's concepts`_ for description of roles of all these tools, but
you don't need to learn all that. You should get used to vagga_ basics to be
productive, though. Luckily there are `plenty of tutorials`_.
